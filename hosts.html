                        furbabies (dog). We are firm believers in families are more than DNA, but rather built on choose
                        and love. We are believers in speaking out against injustice and being both the voice and the
                        ally of those who cannot be heard</p>

                        My true crime obsession began as a young girl both witnessing and living the effects of poverty,
                        racism, and sexism. I am one of nine children with a complex family tree that needs a board with
                        lots of red string to fully understand. To further compound the issues, we are a biracial family
                        trying to navigate growing up in a less than accepting Conservative Red-leaning State. After my
                        parents divorce, my mother raised five of us on less than 30,000 dollars a year, which lead to
                        many of my siblings making regrettable choices to survive. These choices greatly impacted them,
                        our family structure, and inadvertently me. I now strive to protect others from going through
                        the same situations through education, understanding, and advocacy.

                        My coffee obsession started when I was a young girl in the Pacific Northwest. Land of Starbucks,
                        pine trees, rednecks, and hippies. Coming of age during the dawn of the internet, I learned to
                        look at the world a new way, and it was important to me to always know what was happening in the
                        world. Doing this podcast allows me to share my observations about current events and hang out
                        with my best friend.
