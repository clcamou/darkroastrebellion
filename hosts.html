                        choose
                        and love. We are believers in speaking out against injustice and being both the voice and the
                        ally of those who cannot be heard. Come join us for discussions on social justice, current
                        events, and true crime. </p>

                                My true crime obsession began as a young girl both witnessing and living the effects of
                                poverty, racism, and sexism. I am one of nine children with a complex family tree that needs a
                                board with lots of red string to fully understand. To further compound the issues, we are a
                                biracial family trying to navigate growing up in a less than accepting Conservative Red-leaning State.
                                After my parents divorce, my mother raised five of us on less than 30,000 dollars a year, which
                                lead to many of my siblings making regrettable choices to survive. These choices greatly
                                impacted them, our family structure, and inadvertently me. I now strive to protect others from going
                                through the same situations through education, understanding, and advocacy.

                                My coffee obsession started when I was a young girl in the Pacific Northwest. Land of
                                Starbucks, pine trees, rednecks, and hippies. Coming of age during the dawn of the internet, I
                                learned to look at the world a new way, and it was important to me to always know what was
                                happening in the world. Doing this podcast allows me to share my observations about current events and
                                hang out with my best friend.
